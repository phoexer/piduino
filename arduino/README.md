Let's Arduino
==============

I'll be honest, I'm not actually a fan of the Arduino platform but i respect it. I like 
what it has done for the maker community and I like the fact that it is open source. But I hate 
the under powerednessness of it all. I hate that it is so limited. I hate that I have to jump through 
hoops to use Rust on it. I hate that I have to use C/C++ to program it. 

But again, I respect it. I respect the fact that it has made it so easy for people to get into
microcontrollers. I respect that it's cheap and accessible. I respect that it's open source. I respect but
I don't like it.

I will be using it, however, because right tool for the right job and all that.
