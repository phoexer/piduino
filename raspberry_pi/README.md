My Raspberry Pi
===============

This is my Raspberry Pi repository. 
I love Raspberry Pi. Way more than Arduino. I love the power and expandability of it. I love that
I can use Rust on it. I love that I can use Python on it. I love that I can use C/C++ on it. I love 
that I can use anything on it.
I don't have to use the default OS, I can put any, and that's awesome.

I will be using it, because it's awesome, right tool for the right job and all that be damned!
